# Grid Heist Strategy Notes (RAG Corpus)

## General Strategy
- Keys unlock vaults; vaults are the biggest single scoring action.
- Avoid collisions: wasted moves are costly in a short match.
- Steal can swing momentum if a target is holding keys.

## Early Game
- Prioritize nearby treasure and keys.
- Avoid being trapped; keep routes open.

## Mid Game
- If you have a key and are near a vault, opening it is usually optimal.
- If an opponent has keys and is near a vault, consider stealing or blocking.

## Late Game
- Secure vault points if possible.
- If you cannot reach a vault, focus on highest-value treasure tiles.

## Negotiation (Optional)
- Deals are not enforced; treat them as soft agreements.
- If you accept a deal, consider reputation impact in later rounds.
